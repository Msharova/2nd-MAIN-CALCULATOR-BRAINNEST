# Calculator for Brainnest
## This was a project for Brainnest that was made in team with [Francis Pama](https://github.com/francisbcn).
### Calculator contains contain all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators (add, substract, multiply,divide). Users are able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = yields 42. Also, it rounds answers with long decimals so that they donâ€™t overflow the screen. Moreover, calculator has keyboard support.
